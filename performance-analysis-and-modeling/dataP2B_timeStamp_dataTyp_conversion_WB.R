'Purpose: Normalizes TimeStampBegin in the PTB control dataset by converting any date-time strings
to Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch, UTC). Produces a consistent CSV used by later scripts.
(# solve problem with different data types in the time stamps of the dataP2B file)

Usage:
  - Adjust: savepath and the input CSV path.
- Run in R/RStudio. No extra packages required (base R only).

Inputs:
  - df_PTB_Ctrl_Preprocessed.csv (may contain mixed types in TimeStampBegin: POSIX-like strings and/or numeric)

Outputs (to savepath):
  - df_PTB_Ctrl_Preprocessed_UnixTS.csv (TimeStampBegin values converted to numeric Unix seconds)

Notes:
  - Conversion uses UTC and format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS"; only rows matching the regex pattern are converted.
- Optional: after conversion, coerce the whole column to numeric for consistency, e.g.:
  df$TimeStampBegin <- as.numeric(df$TimeStampBegin)
